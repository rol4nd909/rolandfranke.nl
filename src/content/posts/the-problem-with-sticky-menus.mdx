## The problem with sticky menus and what to do instead

_Designers_ use sticky menus (menus that stick to the edge of the viewport) to make them easy to access on long pages. But this fancy pattern hurts UX far more than it improves it.
Here's why:

### #1: They constantly take up space

They get in the way of the actual content. And it's worse on small screens where space is more limited.

### #2: They obscure content

For example, Material Design's floating action button always gets in the way of the content behind it.

### #3: They break when you zoom in

When zooming in, the size of the sticky menu can increase to a point where there's little space for the content.

On mobile, sticky menus may disappear upwards. They may also become misaligned or slightly cropped.

### #4: They're difficult to access

If a sticky menu is taller than the content and viewport, users will be unable to access the bottom of the menu (in some browsers).

Even if the content is taller than the menu, users still have to scroll to the bottom of the content to see the menu which is long winded.

You could add an inner scroll bar to the menu. But <Link href="https://baymard.com/blog/inline-scroll-areas" target="blank">multiple scroll bars are hard to use</Link>.

### #5: Internal page anchors feel broken when clicked twice

Some sticky menus contain links that take users to content down the page.

When the user clicks the same link for a second time nothing happens, which makes the interface feel broken.

### #6: They appear closer than they are

Sticky menus are always visually accessible, but in reality are far away for keyboard users navigating with the tab key.

### #7: They obscure links and other focusable elements

Users who navigate back up the page by keyboard may end up focusing on a link that's obscured by the sticky menu.

## The problem with sticky menus that appear on scroll and what to do instead

**This seems smart because:**

- the menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content
- it allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top

**But this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.**

Here's why:

### #1: They're distracting

This is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.
Good design doesn't guess (wrongly) about what users need.

### #2: They're hard to control

This is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it's not wanted, and scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.

Good design doesn't take control away.

### #3: They cause dizziness and nausea

This is because <Link href="https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/" target="blank">animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more</Link>.

Good design avoids physical stress.

### #4: They can impact performance

This is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.

Good design is lightweight.

#### What to do instead

1. **Keep pages short**: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.
2. **Just let users scroll**: It's a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.
3. **Put relevant links in context**: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.
4. **Use a back-to-top link**: They're relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).
