## Describing the State

This state could be described as a "transitory snap" or "flyover snap." It's a state
where elements are momentarily in the snap zone but aren't selected as the final snap
target. The key focus is on recognizing that these elements have passed through a
significant area that could be important for visual feedback or interaction.

## Naming the Event

Given the behavior and the intent, here are some potential names and their reasoning:
1. `snapflyover:` This directly conveys the idea that the element "flies
over" the snap zone without being snapped to. It's descriptive and implies a
transient interaction.
2. `snaptransit:` Suggests that the element is in transit across the snap
area, signaling that it's just passing by rather than stopping.
3. `snapcross:` Indicates that the element has crossed into or through the
snap area but didn't settle there.
4. `snaphover:` Evokes the idea of the element hovering or passing over the
snap area momentarily. However, this could be confusing with traditional "hover"
events in CSS, which are related to pointer events.
5. `snapintersect:` Suggests that the element has intersected the snap area,
emphasizing the geometric or positional relationship rather than the action of
snapping.

### Is This Still a Snap Event?

Yes, it's still related to snapping, but it's more of an interim or auxiliary snap
event. It adds a finer level of control and feedback in the snapping process, especially
for cases where visual or interactive feedback is needed as elements scroll through the
snap zone.

### Final Thoughts

Out of the options, `snapflyover` seems to be the most intuitive and descriptive
for what you're trying to achieve. It clearly conveys the idea that the element is moving
over the snap area without stopping there, which matches your use case well.

If you wanted to focus more on the idea of the event being triggered as the element
intersects the snap area, then `snapintersect` could be a good alternative. It's
a bit more technical but might resonate well with developers.
