## Rebeccapurple Takes the Spotlight!
The wait is over! With a resounding 400 votes, rebeccapurple has been crowned the official logo color for CSS. This moment marks a significant milestone for the CSS community as we finalize a concept that's been brewing with your feedback, ideas, and support. The choice of rebeccapurple isn't just a nod to a striking color it's a heartfelt tribute to Rebecca Meyer, daughter of web standards advocate Eric Meyer. Her memory lives on in this enduring symbol of the web, as rebeccapurple has been an official CSS color since 2014.
